Welcome to the :whiterose: Yorkshire discord, there seems to have been a few of these but non seem to still be around - so here we are. This is a localised discord server for connecting with people nearby and making some online pals that you can grab a beer with too.

Invite your friends from :whiterose: Yorkshire to the server so we can build the largest, and only community of :whiterose: Yorkshire-folk in discord.

We have lots of emotes available for discord nitro users, so get using 'em! Perhaps use this to display your favourite team in your custom status?

People from outside of :whiterose: Yorkshire welcome, however you will have to be shamed with an appropriate role.

Set your username colour, favourite teams, etc here: #ðŸ”›options 

No minimum ages or any other barriers here - though you may not have access to everything if you're not old enough (to save your eyes!)

If you have any suggestions, please send them to a mod!
